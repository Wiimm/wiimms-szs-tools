 - Windows version only: Update to Cygwin DLL 3.0.0 / 2019-02-16.
 - A binary KCL with different section order is accepted now (like KMP before).
 - The new option --repair-magics[=MODE] controls the reparing of missing or
   wrong magics of files and sub-files  by analysing file path and file
   extension. MODE is one of OFF, ANALYSE or REPAIR.
 - Command FLOAT accepts '+' and '-' to print the nearest successor and
   predecessor of the previous value.
 - New command: wszst VR-CALC: Calculate a VR increment for each given delta
   value (=VR_winner-VR_loser). Print results as table.

 - Bug fix for BMG processing: Tools ran into endless loop, if an incorrect
   1A-escape tells a length of zero.
 - BMG Filter option --msg renamed to the more meaningful name --filter-bmg.
   The old name is still available.
 - BMG Filter option --filter-bmg=modes supports more keywords now.
   See https://szs.wiimm.de/opt/filter-bmg for details.
 - Option --patch-bmg=mode[cond][=param]: The new optional condition COND is

szs v2.01b r7802 - 2019-03-21

 - Bug fix for v2.01a: The string support of the text parser had an memory
   allocation bug. wctct uses the new string functions since v2.01 and
   produces occasional (~25%) wrong CT-CODE files (strap files).


szs v2.02a r7827 - 2019-05-04

 - New option for wlect: --move1-tracks: Files with more than one hard link
   are copied and removed and not moved to create an unique version of the
   file.

   and text of message MID2 to message MID1. Forward and chained references
   are allowed. Multi message ids like 'T12' are supported on both sides.
 - New escape sequence for BMG text files: \m{a,b,...}: Each parameter is
   interpreted as message id. If a message with given ID exists (must be
   defined before and must not have an assigned value), then insert the text
   of the message.
 - New option for wszst EXTRACT: --basedir=DIRECTORY: Extract only files from
   archives, that are below the DIRECTORY. Leading points and slashes and
   trailing slahes are removed from the parameter. --bdir is short cut.

   messages to the macro library. The macro library is accessed by escape
   sequence \m{MID} as fallback.
 - New escape sequence for BMG text files: \M{a,b,...}: Each parameter is
   interpreted as message id. If a message with given ID is defined by the
   macro library, then insert the text of the message.
 - New command: wkmpt KTPT: Analyse the start positions (KMP:KTPT) and lap
   counters (KMP:CKPT) and print a simple information list. Use enemy points
   (KMP:ENPT) to find recommendations. This command is dedicated to LE-CODE,
   which supports an alternative position for the finish line at the minimap.
 - New patch option for wszst and wkmpt: --ktpt2=vector
   Insert or replace a second KTPT. Use VECTOR as new position. Then find
   nearest lap counter (CKPT with mode 0) and adjust position and direction.


szs v2.04a r7864 - 2019-06-02

 - New option for wszst and wimgt: --cmpr-default=rgb1[,rgb2]
   Define 2 colors for the case, that all 16 pixels of a CMPR block are
   transparent. The default is to calculate an average color of all
   transparent pixels. Before v2.04 white was used.
 - Command wszst DISTRIBUTION: Added battle arena support.
 - Option --bmg-inline removed. It is deprecated since 2015.


szs v2.05a r7879 - 2019-06-09

 - Warnings for not supported versions and for wrong number of sections of
   BRRES sub files (CHR, CLR, MDL, PAT, SCN, SHP, SRT and TEX) implemented.
   Some of these invalid sub files will freeze the Wii:
    - New command: wszst BRSUB: If no file is defined, print a table with
      known BRRES sub files consisting of file format, version, number of
      sections and warn message. Otherwise analyse the version number and
      number of sections of each BRRES sub file of each source and print
      warnings about invalid sub files. This is like command CHECK, but only
      for BRRES sub files.
    - Command wszst CHECK will check BRRES files now. For SZS files, all BRRES
      sub files are checked. At the moment only valid version numbers and
      number of sections are tested.
    - Command wszst LIST: If displaying version numbers, invalid version
      numbers for BRRES sub files will be marked by an appended "!" and
      highlighted by magenta background if colors are activated.
 - Bug fix for wszst DISTRIBUTION: Scanning of slot numbers failed.
 - Option --ktpt2 accepts keyword AUTO now and calculates the position
   automatically. The result is the recommendation of command wkmpt KTPT.


szs v2.06a r7905 - 2019-07-01

 - CT-CODE definition files: Added additional and optional field IDENTIFIER to
   optimize track-to-cup references.
 - Support for outdated LE-CODE phase 1 removed.
 - Bug fix for option --ktpt2: KMP is marked as modified now, so that the
   KMP of the source file is updated..
 - Support of files ObjFlow.bin and GeoHitTable*.bin (binary and text).
 - New commands: wszst BINARY and wszst TEXT: Both commands work like the
   ENCODE and DECODE commands of the other tools. The main idea is to support
   simple text-to-binary and binary-to-text conversions of new file formats by
   tool wszst instead of creating own tools for every new file format.
    - Command wszst BINARY: Read each source file (binary or text, but not an
      archive) and write it as binary file.
    - Command wszst TEXT: Read each source file (binary or text, but not an
      archive) and write it as text file.
    - Currently supported file formats are BMG, GEOHIT, KCL, KMP, LEX,
      OBJFLOW, PAT and the related text formats.
 - New option: wszst --delta: Print only modified records on text output.
   Supported file formats until now: GEOHIT, OBJFLOW


szs v2.07a r7960 - 2019-08-30

 - New file formats to distinguish GeoHitTable*.bin (standard variant) from
   GeoHitTable*Obj.bin ("Obj" variant).
 - Command wszst TEXT for OBJFLOW and GEOHIT updated to support new file
   formats and new features.
 - If extracting an U8 or WU8 archive, then course.kcl.*, course.kmp.txt and
   course.lex.txt are always added to the exclude list of control file
   wszst-setup.txt. Files course.kcl, course.kmp and course.lex are added to
   the encode list. Before the files were only added, if the binary file
   exists and option --decode was set.
 - Command wlect CREATE CANNON: Create a LEX text file with cannon section
   only.
 - Command wszst ANALYZE updated to support calculated attributes of tracks
   for web site https://ct.wiimm.de/
 - BMG section INF1: Maximum attribute length increased from 16 to 32 bytes.
 - BMG: The tools support only BMG encoding #2 (UTF-16/be) fully. Encoding #1
   (CP1252) can be read, but not be stored as binary BMG file. Error messages
   are printed for unsupported encodings.
 - BMG: Unknown parameters of sections INF1 and MID1 are scanned and written.
 - New BMG option: --bmg-encoding=NAME: Force a BMG encoding. It is only
   relevant if creating a BMG file. Accepted encoding names are: CP-1252,
   UTF-16BE (or UTF-16), SHIFT-JIS, UTF-8 and AUTO for automatic detection
   (default). Same keywords without minus signs are accepted too.
   At the moment, only encodings CP-1252 and UTF-16BE are supported on reading
   and only encoding UTF-16BE on writing a binary BMG. MKWii uses UTF-16BE.
 - New command: wbmgt EXTRACT name source: Extract BMG section NAME of file
   SOURCE and write the binary data to standard output. If NAME consists of
   less than 4 characters, then the first section that starts with these
   characters is dumped.
 - New command: wbmgt SECTIONS source...: List all sections of each binary
   BMG file. Print offset, size, magic and a short info. If known, print
   number and size of elements too.

 - BMG: Encoding of types CP1252, UTF-16be, Shift-JIS and UTF-8 are fully
   supported now.
 - New command: wbmgt SLOTS source...: Print a slot ordered list with slot
   number, message id, delta and attributes.
 - BMG supports predifined slots now. These slot assignments are detected
   automatically while reading binary BMG files. Slot assignments are saved to
   and scanned from BMG text files.
 - BMG text files: Each message ID can be followed by '@SLOT' to force a slot
   number for the message.
 - BMG: Unknown sections are stored as hex dumps into BMG text files. The hex
   dumps can be edited and are scanned on reading. Each section is started by
   parameter "@SECTION NAME".
 - BMG section INF1: Maximum attribute length increased from 32 to 40 bytes.


szs v2.09a r8000 - 2019-09-24

 - New keywords for option --filter-bmg: ALLCODE, ALLCUPS, ALLTRACKS,
   ALLARENAS and ALLREFS.
 - The optional parameter of option --le-code (LE-CODE phase) is deprecated
   and ignored. From now on, option --le-code always enables LE-CODE (phase 2)
   and CT-CODE support.
 - Deprecated and useless option --smart removed.
 - KMP/GOBJ, ID: Support of objects flags in bits 10-15 (0xfc00) for LE-CODE.
 - File course.lex: Support of new section TEST. It forces game modes like
   "Online, 12 players, itemrain" to test them in standard offline versus.

 - New command: wkmpt GAMEMODES: Analyze the presence flags combinations with
   and without extension support and print a list.
 - New command: wszst DUPLICATE: It reads a single track file and duplicates
   it several times. Therefor it analyzes the presence flags combinations with
   and without extension support and creates one file for each relevant
   scenario. A LEX section TEST will be inserted to force the execution mode
   for offline tests.
 - New option for commands wkmpt GAMEMODES and wszst DUPLICATE:
   --gamemodes=list: Select game modes for the list.

   settings of the extended presence flags, if they are destroyed by another
   KMP tool. --repxpf is a short cut for this option.
 - Option --auto-add was broken for objects, if flags (bits 10-12) were set.
   Bit 12 is used by extended presence flags (XPF).
 - Support of random selections of KMP/GOBJ objects:
    - 6 random scenarios supported.
    - New keyword for option --gamemodes: RANDOM.

 - New command: wszst IS-TEXTURE: Test tracks to see if it's a texture hack.
 - wszst ANALYZE: Detect goombas with scale other than 1.00.


szs v2.27b r8534 - 2022-05-22

 - Bug fix for scanning DEBUG-* sections of LPAR.txt: Parameters ITEM-POINT and
   KCL-TYPE were not recognized.


szs v2.28a.beta r8612 - 2022-07-09

 - There is a new property for parsing the command line. In a preliminary
   step, the options "-@FILENAME" (1 argument) and "-@ FILENAME" (2 arguments)
   are searched. Each occurrence is replaced by the contents of file FILENAME,
   which again may contain "-@...". The maximum recursion depth is 10.
   Wildcard patterns are not resolved.
 - New command for all tools: EXPAND: All parameters are treated as a filename
   with wildcards and all matching files are searched.
 - New command: wszst SPLIT: Analyse (file) names and split them into the
   different parts. Print the results in machine readable format.
 - Command wlect CREATE re-implemented. Type 'wlect create help' for details.
 - New command: wlect DISTRIBUTION: The command manages data for LE-CODE track
   distributions. It reads any number of source files with different file
   types, collects the data and creates any number of files with different
   file types. Type 'wlect distribution' without arguments to get details.
 - New file formats to support wlect DISTRIBUTION: LE-DEF, LE-DIS, LE-REF,
   LE-STR, SHA1REF and PREFIX.


szs v2.28a.beta2 r8627 - 2022-08-06

 - There is a new LEX section called "FEAT". It declares the special features
   of a track file. CTGP-R uses this declaration to manage ghost.
    - Command "wszst FEATURES" prints the feature list to standard output.
    - Command "wlect CREATE FEAT" creates a LEX template with section FEAT.
    - Patching option --lex-features adds or updates LEX section FEAT if any
      relevant feature is set.
    - Patching option --lex-rm-features removes LEX section FEAT.
 - Continuing the implementation of wlect DISTRIBUTION:
    - Fixed a use after free bug (Cygwin only, fixed with r8614).
    - Export of prefix list supports color_index now.
    - Improved filename normalisation (Cygwin only).
    - The file formats LE-REF and LE-DIS changed. They are *NOT* compatible
      to v2.28a.beta.
    - Support of lap count and speed factor for file formats LE-DEF and LE-REF.
    - New instruction: SEPARATOR=string. Define a separator that is used by
      other instructions (e.g. COPY=).
    - New instruction: SPLIT=DEST,SRC,FORMAT.
      Visit https://szs.wiimm.de/opt/printf for details.
 - New option: wszst SPLIT --printf=format: Use the split filename to create
   a formatted string. See https://szs.wiimm.de/opt/printf for details.


szs v2.28a r8636 - 2022-08-27

 - Continuing the implementation of LEX/FEAT:
    - Command wszst FEATURES: Options for value 3 (impact) are printed always.
    - Option --print-modes removed.
    - Option --long (-l and -ll) used to append human readable flags.
 - wlect DISTRIBUTION: Minor optimizations.
 - Updated internal prefix database.
 - Tool wstrt: Option --add-section=PATH supports now wildcards. In this case
   PATH is used as search pattern and all found files are added. In order to
   use this variant, the calling shell must not interpret the wildcards.
   Therefore, PATH must usually be enclosed in single or double quotes.
 - Bug fix: Option --all-ranks accepts keyword RESTORE now. Due to a spelling
   mistake, only RETORE was recognized so far.


szs v2.29a r8691 - 2022-10-27

 - Updated prefix, object and porting databases.
 - Updated integrated LE-CODE binaries to v4 build 34.
 - Support of LE-CODE v4.b34 with 8-bits flags and v5.b35 with 16-bits flags.
 - Added LE-CODE protection against changes by SZS tools that are too old.
 - LPAR: Support of new features BT-TEXTURES, VS-TEXTURES and BLOCK-TEXTURES.
 - Bug fix: If creating a LPAR file (by "wlect create lpar" or by decoding),
   some lines are terminated by LF instead of CR+LF. This could lead to
   problems with some Windows editors and other Windows programs.
 - Bug fix: The wildcard ** did not work correctly. The recursion depth was
   always 1 level higher than specified. So level 0 was never possible.
   See https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/wildcards#2stars for details.
 - wszst ANALYZE:
    - Added support for LE-CODE binaries.
    - A track can be valid, even if vrcorn_model.brres is missed.
    - Support of edit-slot ('e12' or 'ea12').
 - wszst SPLIT: Added support for "(author1,author2,,editor1,editor2)",
   LE-CODE flags + group, order by attribute, and for track category.
 - New file type: MTCAT: Import and export 'MKW Track Category' files.


szs v2.29b r8696 - 2022-10-28

 - wszst ANALYZE lecode: Changed output names.


szs v2.30a r8708 - 2022-11-11

 - Command "wlect DUMP":
    - Accept option --brief to print file header of LE-CODE binaries only.
    - New command "wlect DB" is a short cut for "wlect DUMP --brief".
    - New command "wlect DLLL" is a short cut for "wlect DUMP -lll".
    - Fixed some issues if displaying LE-CODE v5 dates.
    - Dump of LE-CODE binaries improved.

    - Updated distribution generator "distrib=...".
    - New processing option: +CUT-ALL.
 - File format #LE-DEF:
    - Section [TRACK-LIST]: New instruction IGNORE-SLOT to ignore SLOT
      instructions. When exporting, SLOT instructions are now inserted so that
      an identical track distribution is achieved when reading in.
    - Section [CUP-LIST]: New instructions APPEND-BT and APPEND-VS to force
      the cup type (battle or versus). This is important for random tracks.


szs v2.31a r8725 - 2022-12-16

 - Updated integrated LE-CODE binaries to v5 build 36.
 - LPAR: Official support of new features BT-WORLDWIDE and VS-WORLDWIDE. This
   was already implemented hidden in version v2.29a.

   cup-icons, as used e.g. by MKW-Fun. At the moment only an incomplete
   documentation is available at https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/genericimg .


szs v2.32a r8742 - 2022-12-25

 - wszst SPLIT: New output record: distrib_flags="number flags".
 - wlect DISTRIB:
    - Instructions cup-icons= and cup-info=:

    - Instruction distrib=: Improved track list.
    - New instruction report=: Analyse the distribution and print a report.
 - Tool wimgt: Improved generic images.
 - Fixed some pager and color issues.


szs v2.33a r8773 - 2023-01-14

 - Fixed a bug that probably exists since v2.29a: Using option --auto-add with
   SZS files with unusal or empty sub-files could cause a crash in certain
   circumstances.
 - Updated prefix database (added MP7).
 - Optimized spacing of fonts for cup icons.
 - wszst LIST including all short cuts like 'wszst LLL':
    - Wildcards are accepted as source. See https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/wildcards
      for details. After evaluating the wildcards, all input files are sorted
      according to their path. Duplicates are remove from the list.

      change the menu as required by LE-CODE to be able to select tracks from
      more than 8 cups.
    - New option --title-screen=dir: Specify a directory from which to search
      and replace title screens. Title screens only appear in the file
      'Title.szs' and there in the sub-directory './title/timg/'.
    - New option --cup-icons=file: Load given image, convert it to TPL.CMPR
      and add the result as sub-files 'button/timg/ct_icons.tpl' and as
      'control/timg/ct_icons.tpl' to files 'Channel.szs', 'MenuMulti.szs' and
      'MenuSingle.szs'.
 - wlect DISTRIB:
    - If a filename beginns with a plus sign, the plus sign is removed and the
      output file is opened in append mode.
    - If an output file is opened for the second time, then it is
      automatically opened in append mode.
    - Instruction report=: Added methods of analysis: CLASSES, XCLASSES.
 - New command: wszst UI-CHECK: Classify SZS files from directory ./Scene/UI/.
   For the analysis, the filename is ignored and only the content is examined.
   Wildcards and option --in-order are supported.
 - New option: wszst --parallel: Tell the tool that it will be called multiple
   times in parallel. Currently it only has an effect if --cache is enabled.
 - New LPAR setting: STATICR-POINTS.

szs v2.36a r8834 - 2023-07-22

 - Wildcard parsing has been reworked. In particular, the pipe character is
   now used as a special control character. In addition, the combined use with
   sub-files has been implemented for some commands. See built-in help and
   https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/wildcards for details.
 - New global option --no-wildcards: Disable wildcard parsing and use each
   filename exactly as specified.
 - The 114 commands of the following list including their short cuts accept
   wildcards as source now:

    - LPAR:DEVELOPER-MODES can allow or forbid different developer modes.
    - LPAR:DEV-MODE1 .. LPAR:DEV-MODE3: Define some global developer modes.
    - New LEX section DEV1: Define some track dependent developer modes.


szs v2.37a r8863 - 2023-09-09

 - Option --max-file-size=SIZE now accepts sizes up to 2 GiB. For LTA files
   it is automatically set to 2 GiB.
 - New file format: LTA = LE-CODE Track Archive.
   Sometime in the future such archives will replace the individual track
   files to save space (smaller file list) in LE-CODE distributions. In
   addition, common files are to be managed so that the extraction of these
   files by the distribution creator is no longer necessary.
 - New file format: LFL = LE-CODE File List
   The file format was developed to store the common files in LTA files in
   a way that LE-CODE can use easily.
 - wlect distrib:
    - New string type 'PATH', which manages paths to the track files.
    - New instructions LTA=DIRECTORY and LTA-RM=DIRECTORY, which will create
      LE-CODE Track Archives.
 - wszst XCOMMON: If at least 1 file is extracted, then file "avail.txt" is
   created. This helps LE-CODE to detect extracted common files, because we
   don't know how to detect directories by LE-CODE.
 - New LPAR setting: USE-AVAIL-TXT.
