szs v0.01a.beta r2385 - 2011-03-31

 - new Tool: wszst (Wiimms SZS Tool)
   The following main commands are supported:
     LIST, COMPRESS, DECOMPRESS, EXTRACT, CREATE.


szs v0.01a r2392 - 2011-04-01

 - Bug fix for "wszst CREATE": Wrong calculation of parent directory link.
 - New option: wszst CREATE --align: Overwrite the default aligment (32=0x20).
 - wszst LIST: If --long is set three times debugging mode is enabled.
 - wszst LIST: If listing a directory, then a virtual SZS file is created
   (like CREATE do it) and listed.
 - New command: wszst DIFF: Compare two sources (each SZS, U8 or directory)
   on file level and report mismatches for each sub file.


szs v0.02a r2417 - 2011-04-04

 - New option: --max-file-size: This options set the limit for input files.
   The default value is 20 MiB.
 - Option --dest: If the parameter is '-' the output is redirected to stdout.
 - New tool: wbmgt: Wiimms BMG Tool
   Commands:
     - LIST   : List a message file to proof the content.
     - PATCH  : Patch the entered text files.
     - DECODE : Decode (and patch) the entered text files.
     - ENCODE : Encode (and patch) the entered text files.


szs v0.03a r2437 - 2011-04-06

 - wszst: Compression algorithm improved: The compression is now about 40%-50%
   faster than before.
 - wszst: New option --compr=level: define a compression level between 0-9.
   Three clear text parameters accepted too: NONE=0, FAST=1 and BEST=9.
 - wszst: New option --fast: This is a short cut for --compr=fast. Usually
   "CREATE --fast" needs about 1/4 of time, but creates ~25% larger SZS files.
 - New command: wszst CAT: Extract one or more sub files of SZS/U8 archives.
   The output is written to stdout. Multiple outputs are concatenated.
 - New command: wbmgt DIFF: Compare two BMG (raw or text) file on string level
   and report mismatches for each string.
 - wbmgt --patch: new mode: HIDE
 - wbmgt is able to read BMG files directly from a SZS file. Just use a
   combined path as 'my.szs/message/Common.bmg'
 - new option: --ignore: Ignore non existing source files without warning.


szs v0.04a r2457 - 2011-04-09

 - SZS compression improved: It uses now overlaps and save about 2% size.
   With more complicated algorithm (that needs much more time) better
   compression is possible -- but it's not worth it.
 - wszst LIST --long: View the magic (first 4 bytes) of each file too.
 - wszst can list, diff, (de-)compress and extract SZS.BRRES files.
 - wbgmt: Bug fix: Wrong string end detection for the last message if
   scanning Nintendos 0x1a (CTRL-Z, ASCII 'SUB') escape sequences.
 - BGM/TEXT format: Allow \z{head,value} for Nintendos 0x1a escape sequence.
 - Bug fix for wszst+wbmgt DIFF: Some files only in source #2 were not listed.
 - New command: wszst NORMALIZE: resort and recompress an U8 archive.
 - New option: wszst --norm: Force normalization while copying/converting.
 - Many layout things.


szs v0.05a r2498 - 2011-04-15

 - Code view & fine tuning (many little things...)
 - wszst NORMALIZE: Bug fixed if source does not contain a "." directory.
 - wszst CREATE+NORMALIZE: The files are ordered like Nintendo does it.
 - New command: wszst SHA1: calculate and print the SHA1 checksum of
   the decompressed data of all source files.
 - wszst+wbmgt DIFF: If option --dest is set then all sources are compared
   with the destination.
 - New option: wszst --pdir (`point directory'): Decides if a base directory
   named "." should be created. Modes are: REMOVE, AUTO, FORCE.
 - New option: --preserve: If set, mtime and atime of the source(s) are used
   to set the destination time stamps.
 - wbmgt: If creating a text BMG file option --ho-header (or -H) suppresses
   the output of the syntax information section.
 - wbmgt: If creating a text BMG file the message IDs for tracks, battle
   tracks and chat messages will be replaced by 'Txx', 'Uxx' and 'Mxx'.
   This feature is disabled if option ---long is set.


szs v0.06a r2540 - 2011-04-27

 - If extracting a SZS, U8 or BRRES archive a file named 'wszst-setup.txt' is
   created. It contains some infos for a following creation.
 - New option --ignore-setup: Ignore setup file 'wszst-setup.txt'.
 - Option --pdir renamed to --pt-dir. --pdir is still allowed.
 - wszst CREATE: Can now create a BRRES file as copy of a directory structure.
 - wbmgt: If creating text BMG files, than unicode escapes "\z{801,hexnum}"
   are written as \u{hexnum}. v0.05a can already scan such unicode escapes.
 - wbmgt: new patch mode "print": create a new text using %s-escapes (like
   print functions) to insert the old one.
 - "wszst EXTRACT" can extract archives recursively and can decode BMG files
   on the fly. This is controlled by the options --recurse, --decode and
   --all. All needed information for recreation is stored in the setup file
   'wszst-setup.txt'.
 - "wszst CREATE" creates a recursively directory structure created by EXTRACT
   using 'wszst-setup.txt' as script. Files will be encoded again.


szs v0.07a r2584 - 2011-05-05

 - wbmgt --patch mode PRINT:
    - New escape %i inserts the message ID (MID, good for finding IDs)
    - Inserting 'b-e' or 'e' between '%' and conversion character limits the
      number of characters to copy. 'b' (begin) and 'e' (end) are numbers.
 - Bug fix for wszst: The base directory was not always created if the U8
   archive has not point directory as base.
 - Bug fix for wszst: If creating a BRRES file the programm runs sometimes
   in a wrong assertion and terminates.
 - Bug fix for wszst: Adjust all external offsets of BRRES sub files.
 - wszst LIST: Can list files recursive if --recurse or --all is set.
 - wszst: A string pool is added to extracted BRRES sub files. This string
   pool is used for the creation of new BRRES files.
 - "wszst CREATE file.brres" works now, but see also "Known bugs".
 - New command: wszst DUMP: Dump the internal structure of BRRES files. The
   main goal is to verify string relocation.

 - Known bugs:

    - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
      the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.


szs v0.08a r2617 - 2011-05-12

 - Improved support for BRRES sub file versions (more string pointers).
 - wszst EXTRACT --raw: Extract BRRES sub file in raw mode and do not adjust
   string pointers and other offsets.

 - Known bugs:

    - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
      the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.


szs v0.09a r2636 - 2011-05-17

 - New tool: wstrt: Wiimms StaticR Tool: manipulate StaticR files of MKW.
    - It can analyze StaticR files and detects CTGP 4.4. patches and
      modifications of track and arena orders.
    - It can patch StaticR files and modifies the track and arena order.
      So it is possible to move tracks with special features (like snow
      or fog) to other slots.
    - Commands TRACKS and ARENAS show details about tracks and arenas.
      The order may be in StaticR related order.
    - Command FILES shows the track and sound file names of all tracks and
      arenas in machine readable format (not vertically formatted, one space
      to separate columns). The order may be in 'StaticR' related order.
   IMPORTANT: wstrt is EXPERIMENTAL!
 - New option: --tracks=list: This option allow to define a new track order
   for Mario Kart Wii. Tool wstrt uses this option for patching the track
   order. Tools wszst and wbmgt use this to define the relation between Txx
   and real message IDs.
 - New option: --arenas=list: Does the same for arenas as --tracks for tracks.


szs v0.10a r2651 - 2011-05-21

   Mario Kart internal directory './Race/Course'. These files are 32 standard
   track files, 10 arena files, and 9 other files.
 - KMP/CKPT: The KMP compiler is able to make check points visible by using
   and scaling global objects. The interface has changes to allow different
   viewing modes (forget the old settings). See built in help for details.
 - New Command: wszst CHECK: Make a validity check for track files: Try to
   read KMP (and check it) and find unknown, modified, needed and unneeded
   files. This command uses a new internal object and file database.
    - HINT: Unknown file:     This will is not part of any Nintendo track.
    - HINT: Additional file:  Known file with unknown usage.
    - HINT: Modified file:    This file is different to Nintendo tracks.

   a SZS without valid KMP.


szs v0.30a r3548 - 2012-03-10

 - There is a new BRRES subfile iterator. The old one is very strict and do
   wrong things with BRRES strings and names while extracting some custom
   tracks (Nintendo tracks work fine). The new one is more tolerant and runs
   better on custom tracks. Now you can extract and repack every track.
   Use option --OLD to activate the old iterator.


szs v0.31a r3579 - 2012-04-06

 - Bug fix if BRRES sub file is cutted into sections:
   Wrong size calculation of last section, if section type is unknown.
 - BTI support:
    - All tools and listing commands: Detect BTI files and print details.
    - wimgt: Can now convert TPL, TEX, BTI, BREFT and PNG into all directions.
    - wszst: Decode and encode BTI files on the fly.


szs v0.32a r3593 - 2012-04-14

 - Bug fix for option --auto-add: Sometimes a segmentation fault appeared when
   auto adding a missing subdirectory for a missing file.
 - New command: wimgt COPY <source> <dest>
   Copy and convert source image to dest image. The default destination file
   format is selected by scanning the file extension of the destination.
   This is an alternative for the ENCODE and DECODE commands.
 - KMP parser: @DEF.ENUM and @GDEF.ENUM define enumerated values.
 - KMP parser: @DEF.SHIFT and @GDEF.SHIFT define shifted bit masks.


szs v0.33a r3627 - 2012-05-02

 - Because of an update of the internal object & file database, redo the
   command "wszst AUTOADD ./path_to/Race/Course/" to add more files to the
   autoadd database -> see https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/autoadd for more info.
 - wszst CHECK: Detect "optional files".
 - KMP: New command '@HSNAP-TO-ENPT' is similar to '@SNAP-TO-ENPT', but
   ignoring the vertical value of the enemy points.
 - The text parser supports 5 kinds of nested loops (EXPERIMENTAL):
     @LOOP    ... @ENDLOOP   : umlimted loop
     @REPEAT  ... @ENDREPEAT : loop with a predefined repeat count
     @FOR     ... @ENDFOR    : classical 'for' with iterator variable
     @FOREACH ... @ENDEACH   : for each element in list
     @WHILE   ... @ENDWHILE  : classical 'while' with condition
   There are also conditional @BREAK and @CONTINUE.
 - The KMP syntax and semantics documentation is now online available:
    -> https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/kmp/syntax
   The inline documentation in decoded KMP files is now much shorter.
 - Command SYNTAX removed. Use page https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/syntax instead.
 - The backtracking algorithm for analyzing of CKPH + ENPH + ITPH pathes has
   been modified and optimized, because a test version of "Toad's Turnpike"
   has 105 ITPH groups and needs much to much steps and time to calculate
   about 10^28 pathes total.


szs v0.34a r3659 - 2012-05-12

 - KMP text parser extensions:
    - New commands:
       @INCLUDE "filename": include text files.
       @RETURN [val]: returns from the current input file.
       @EXIT: exit the parser execution.
       @ASSERT condition: exit execution, if 'condition' is false.
       @MACRO .. @ENDMACRO: Define named macros.
       @FUNCTION .. @ENDFUNCTION: Like @MACRO, but can also be used as
          function in numerical expressions.
       @CALL macroname(...): Call a previos defined macro with parameters.
          '@:macroname(...)' is a short cut for '@CALL macroname(...):'
       @DOIF (condition) anytext: Execute 'anytext', if 'condition' is true.
    - New private variable name space: @PDEF
       - P-Variables are only defined for the current source file or function.
       - Loop variables (@FOR,@FOREACH) and macro parameters are defined in
         this new private name space.
 - New options for command FUNCTIONS (list parser functions):
    - Option --long: The entered keys are compared against the description.
    - Option --verbose: The description is printed too.
 - Bug fix: Parser function minMax() returned wrong results.


szs v0.35a r3681 - 2012-05-20

 - New options for "wstrt TRACKS+ARENAS": --brief --no-header
 - KMP sections CKPH+ENPH+ITPH: Accept unsorted groups.
 - New patching options:
    - For wszst and wkclt: --kcl-flag=list: Exchange KCL flags in KCL files.
    - For wszst and wkclt: --kcl-parse=script: Execute the script for each KCL
      file and to calculate/modify the KCL flags.
    - For wszst and wkmpt: --rm-gobj=list: Remove global objects in KMP files.
 - New command: wkclt FLAGS: Print usage statistics about KCL flags.
 - New parser functions: ptInCube(cube1,cube2,pt1,...) and a strict variant
   ptInCubeS(cube1,cube2,pt1,...): Count the points in the cube.
 - KCL exporter creates now 3dsMax compatible OBJ files with some issues.


szs v0.36a r3720 - 2012-05-28

 - It the tools 'wkmpt' or 'wkclt' opens a SZS file, they use the internal
   files 'course.kmp' or 'course.kcl' as source.
 - New command: wszst KCL: Open the sub file @course.kcl@, decode and print it.
 - KCL object exporter improved.
 - New command: wkclt DUMP: Dumps the raw KCL records in human readable format.
 - New command: wkclt OCTREE: Traverse and test the octree by using the entered
   points. Logging of steps and triangles is controlled by --long and --brief.
 - wkclt ENCODE: Import an OBJ file and create a new KCL from scratch. The
   internal octree generator works fine and can be controlled by different
   constants. See https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/kcl#encode for more details.
 - If a KCL obj file with name NAME.EXT is scanned, a file name NAME.flag.txt
   is scanned to find relations between group names and flags.
   See https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/kcl#def-flag for more details.
 - Read the new KCL export and import How-To: https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/kcl


szs v0.37a r3748 - 2012-06-02

 - Read "Known Bugs" or https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/kcl about KCL issues.
 - Command "wkclt dump" prints now more octree statistics.
   As the result of the analysis of these statstics, the octree generation has
   been optimized and some new parameters have been established.
 - New command: wkclt TRIANGLES: It's like DUMP, but it print only 1 line
   for each triangle data. The goal is to compare the data with other dumps.
 - New option: --kcl-sort: Sort the triangles by length and positions to make
   a dump more and easier compareable.
 - New option: --kcl-drop: Remove all triangles, that are not referenced by
   the octree. This helps to clean the KCL of custom tracks.
 - The OBJ exporter creates Wavefront OBJ files compatible with "3ds Max" and
   "Google SketchUp" (TIG's OBJ-importer plugin) and maybe with more 3D tools.
   The exported data contains now also 'vn' vectors (normals).
 - The OBJ importer read Wavefront OBJ files created by "3ds Max" and by
   "Google SketchUp" (TIG's OBJ-exporter plugin) and maybe by other 3D tools.


szs v0.38a r3774 - 2012-06-05

 - OBJ import and KCL creation tested with different tracks without issues.
 - New option --kcl=list: 'list' is a comma separated list with keywords to
   define options for the KCL processing. Allowed options are: RESET, FAST,
   NORMALS, OUT-SWAP, IN-SWAP, AUTO, CLIP, DROP, SORT and DEFAULT.
   See https://szs.wiimm.de/opt/kcl for details.
 - The transforming options  --shift, --scale, -xss, -yss, -zss and --hrot
   are now available for KCL processing.
 - Option --kcl-parse renamed to --kcl-script.
 - Three new parser functions for the --kcl-script script:
     tri$setPt()  : Define new triangle points.
     tri$shift()  : Shift all points of a triangle.
     tri$remove() : Remove a triangle from the list.
   If one of these function is used, a new octree is calculated.
 - New parser functions: sec(), mSec(), uSec()
 - Several small bugs in the KCL creation removed.


szs v0.39a r3799 - 2012-06-09

 - The KCL code was cleaned and the internal triangle data base has a new
   optimized data structure. The new KCL tool will create the same KCL as
   the previous r3774. Only the output of some dump commands and also
   the created OBJ files have changed.
 - Three new parser functions for the --kcl-script script:
     tri$create()    : Create a new triangle.
     tri$scale()     : Scale all points of a triangle.
     tri$hRot()      : Rotate all points of a triangle horizontally.
     tri$unremove()  : Clear 'REMOVED' marker
     tri$isRemoved() : Get 'REMOVED' status.
   Call "wkclt func tri$" for complete list of all 12 triangle functions.
 - Command "wkclt OCTREE" renamed to "wkclt TRAVERSE".
 - New command: wkclt COPY <source> <dest>
   Copy and convert source collision file (KCL or OBJ) to dest. The default
   destination file format is selected by scanning the file extension of the
   destination. This is an alternative for the ENCODE and DECODE commands
   for single copy operations.
 - Optimization: If input and output are binary KCL files and only KCL flags
   were changed, then the original KCL data is copied 1:1 to the output file
   and only the flag values are modifed. Use --kcl=new to build always a new
   binary KCL and to disable this optimization.


szs v0.40a r3837 - 2012-06-17

 - Windows version only: Update to Cygwin DLL 1.7.15-1
 - The KCL obj export will now create a material file with adequate colors.
   To disable materials support, use "--kcl -mtl".
 - KCL flag scanning: Some 3D tools use the generic suffix '_number' in goup
   names. This may result in a conflict with the automatic detection of KCL
   flags. Not only therefor, the interface has changed:
    - If creating an OBJ file, '_Fxxxx' (literal '_F' and 4 hex digits)
      instead of '_xxxx' is now appended to the group names.
    - If scanning a groupname, '_Fxxxx' is always accepted as flag value.
    - The old way to detect flag values is now disabled by default, but can be
      enabled by different --kcl keywords: 'HEX4' enables '_ffff' (flag),
      'HEX23' enables '_tt_vvv' (type and variant) and 'HEX' enables both.
    - The flag file may define HEX4 and/ot HEX23 to 0 (disable) or 1 (enable)
      to override the defaults set by option --kcl.
    - For all groups with unknown flag assignments, the unusal values 0xFFE0,
      0xFFC0, 0xFFA0 and so on (all type 0x00 (road), each 0x20 lower) are
      used in this order. This makes the groups discriminable in the KCL.
    - The default extension of the flag file is now '.flag' and not longer
      '.flag.txt'. If scanning both files are searched.
    - The new option --flag-file=path overrides the default search for a flag
      definitions file while scanning OBJ files.
    - New command "wkclt CFF" will create a flag file with all group names
      as template.
 - If scanning a OBJ file, faces (polygons) with up to 50 vertices in a plane
   are supported. Polygons with N>3 are split into adequate triangles.
 - The user interface of the parser function tri$create() has changed to
   allow the definition of polygons with any number of verteces.
 - Bug fix: The naming of some parser functions were wrong: ptInCube*() are
   renamed to ptInCuboid*(). The obsolete old names are allowed for a while.
 - New command: wkclt CHECK: Run a KCL check and return 'DIFFER' as exit
   status if any KCL error found.
 - The KCL creation is now included into the SZS creator: Touched OBJ files
   will now converted to KCL automatically if creating a SZS file.


szs v0.41a r3866 - 2012-06-24

 - Bug fix: The triangle split of a face with exact 4 verteces fails in 50% of
   all cases (bad optimization).
 - Bug fix: The parser expression "a?b:c" fails, if the operators not followed
   by a blank.
 - Bug fix for some parser functions.
 - Using a KCL for defining KMP positions:
   Now it is possible to set a point anywhere and let it fall down until a
   collision. This is a very good function to place global objects and other
   points of the KMP. This internal KCL-FALL is available for the user in
   different stages:
    - Command "wkclt FALL source point..." for testing.
    - Parser functions kcl$fall() and kcl$fallFlag() for scripts.
    - Automatic adjusting of KMP points and objects in the sections CNPT,
      ENPT, GOBJ, ITPT, JGPT, KTPT, MSPT and POTI.


szs v0.42a r3927 - 2012-07-06

 - Linux+Mac: The math library is now included explicitly to avoid a linking
   failure on some systems.
 - Bug fix: Assigning values to private macro variables has overwritten
   existing variables in the standard or global namespace.
 - New parser command: '@PARAM': Define a parameter name list for macro and
   function calls.
 - 'ROUTE-ITEMBOX' replaced by a more flexible 'ROUTE-OBJECT'.
 - New command: wkmpt COBJECT: Create an OBJ file: Load the related KCL and
   add new faces representing the KMP elements are added. Enemy, item, check
   and respawn points and cannon destinations are supported at the moment.
   Option --draw=list decides which elements are included into the OBJ file.
   See https://szs.wiimm.de/cmd/draw for more details.
 - New parser functions: mean(), dir(), xDir(), yDir(), zDir(), rot(), xRot()
   yRot(), zRot(), axisRot(), tri$createCuboid(), tri$createJoist(),
   tri$createPrism() and tri$createPyramid(). The tri$create*() functions are
   internally used to add KMP objects to the OBJ file.
 - New KCL creating parameter: KCL_BLOW: If calculating the overlay between
   cubes and triangles, the cubes are blowed up by the some units, so that a
   triangle may be visible in a neighbor cube. This avoids unexpected rarely
   effects like bike hopping. The default value is 400.
   See https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/kcl#KCL_BLOW for more info.
    * If you have created a KCL with a previous version of my tools, use this
      command to create a new octree:
             wkclt encode course.kcl --kcl drop,new --overwrite
      The file 'course.kcl' will be overwritten with a repaired version.
